P6
# I'm a PPM file! You can tell by the magic header
3 3 # This first number is the width, and the second is the height
# This next number is the maximum intensity of each pixel
# Exporting as "raw" in GIMP always gives 255, which makes sense; this is the
# maximum value of a u8. After this maxval, we are only allowed a single newline
# before the pixels start. These pixels can be arbitrary bytes!
255
